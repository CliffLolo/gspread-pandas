# Supercharge Your Data Analytics with gspread and Pandas


This project demonstrates how to use gspread and Pandas to manage data in Google Sheets. With this duo, you can easily read and write data, as well as analyze and manipulate data in Google Sheets, just like you would with any other data analysis tool.

**This project is based on an article I wrote on medium. I advise you read the medium article before checking out this repo to get the bigger picture.
I talk about how to install gspread and configure it for it to work.**
